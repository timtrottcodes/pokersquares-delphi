# PokerSquares (Delphi)

This is my (old) implementation of a PokerSquares game written in Delphi back in 2005, part as a learning exercise and part as coursework.

Delphi project and source, with an executable in the bin folder.

The original game of poker squares dates back to the late nineteenth century and was first documented as poker squares in the Hoyle series of card rule books in the early 1930s. Other card rule books have also documented the game, calling it 'poker squares', 'poker solitaire', or 'poker patience'.

The deck is shuffled, and you draw 25 cards, one at a time, and place each card on the 5 by 5 grid, attempting to get the best possible poker hand for each row and column. In the Classic game, you may place a card on any unoccupied spot on the grid.

When you're done you will have formed 10 poker hands: one for each row, one for each column. 

You earn points based on the hands you have formed in each round. Cards can be in any order.

Royal Flush - Score 25
Straight Flush - Score 20
Four of a Kind - Score 16
Full House - Score 14
Flush - Score 12
Straight - Score 10
Three of a Kind - Score 6
Two Pairs - Score 4
One Pair - Score 2

* Background images - I have no idea where they came from, something back pre-2005. Any issues let me know and I'll reemove them.
* Cards.dll - Original Microsoft DLL which used to be distributed with Windows but since Windows 7 it was dropped. Included here since nobody should be running Windows 7 or earlier.
